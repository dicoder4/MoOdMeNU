**AI-Powered Food Recommendation System with Agentic Intelligence**

A personal project exploring agentic AI frameworks and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) - because who doesn't want their own AI food agents working together? üöÄ The system implements intelligent agents for food recommendations, period tracking, fitness monitoring, and meal planning, demonstrating how AI agents can collaborate to solve real-world problems (like figuring out what to eat when you're indecisive!).

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Intelligent Food Learning**: AI-powered preference analysis and pattern recognition
- **Agentic Intelligence**: Multiple specialized AI agents working collaboratively (like a mini AI team!)
- **Mood-Based Recommendations**: Contextual meal suggestions for different situations
- **Adaptive Learning**: Gets smarter every time you use it - the more you interact, the better it gets!

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Frontend & Framework**
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web application interface (makes building UIs actually fun!)
- **Python**: Core application logic and data processing
- **Session State Management**: Persistent user preferences and application state

### **Backend & Database**
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for user data, food ratings, and agent interactions
- **PyMongo**: Database connectivity and query management
- **Data Collections**: User profiles, food preferences, agent data, and interaction history

### **AI & Agentic Systems**
- **Google Gemini AI**: Large language model for intelligent meal suggestions
- **Agentic Intelligence Framework**: Memory, perception, and planning systems (the brains behind the operation!)
- **Model Context Protocol**: Exploring structured AI agent communication and context management
- **Natural Language Processing**: Context-aware food recommendations and agent responses

### **Data Processing**
- **BMI Calculation**: Health metric analysis using standard formulas
- **Calorie Computation**: Mifflin-St Jeor equation for BMR and TDEE
- **Rating Analysis**: Statistical analysis of user preferences and agent performance

## ü§ñ Agentic System Components

### **Core AI Agents**
- **Food Agent**: Intelligent meal recommendations and preference learning (your personal food guru!)
- **Period Tracker Agent**: Proactive health monitoring and meal suggestions
- **Fitness Agent**: Health metrics, calorie tracking, and activity-based recommendations
- **Meal Planner Agent**: Multi-day meal planning and variety management

### **Agentic Intelligence Framework**
- **Memory Systems**: Persistent learning and preference storage (remembers what you like!)
- **Perception Modules**: Context awareness and user state understanding
- **Planning Algorithms**: Strategic decision-making and recommendation generation
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Agent coordination for comprehensive solutions

### **MCP Exploration**
- **Context Management**: Structured approach to AI agent context and memory
- **Agent Communication**: Exploring how agents can share and maintain context
- **Task Coordination**: Specialized agent assignment based on user needs
- **Response Aggregation**: Unified recommendations from multiple agent perspectives
